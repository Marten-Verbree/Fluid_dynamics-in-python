# Fluid_dynamics-in-python

This is an attempt at translating the following code in c++ to python. https://mikeash.com/pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html

The biggest challenge shall be to visualise the end result, which is something I have never done before.
Other challenges I see are:
- Implementing numerical methods to solve differential equations
- Understanding c++

Excited to see how this will go.
